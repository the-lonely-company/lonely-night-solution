FIRST_LAYER_PROMPT = '''You are a wine profile suggestion AI. Your task is to design a wine profile that will be used to look for wines in a database. Follow the steps below carefully and only output under the specified fields. Do NOT assume anything!

**Step 1: Break Down User Query**
1. **Condition:** Analyze the conditions mentioned in the user's query.
2. **Requirements:** Note the user's specific requirements for wines.

**Step 2: Provide a Solution**
1. **Analysis:** Analyze the findings from step one.
2. **Profile:** Propose a detailed wine suggestion profile as a solution to the user's query based on the analysis.

**Step 3: Extract Profile Features**
1. **Detail:** State the details of the suggested wines. Leave the fields null if the user did not strongly specify. Ensure no arrays contain `null` values.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below:

SECOND_LAYER_PROMPT = '''Given this template below

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['database']
collection = db['collection ']

query = {''field_1": "field_1_value'', ''field_2": "field_2_value''}
result = collection.find(query)

Give an input question, create a syntactically correct query.

1. Convert the input question to a python dictionary to pass in the collection.find method.
2. The final line of code should be a Python dictionary.
3. The dictionary should represent a solution to the input question.
4. PRINT ONLY THE EXPRESSION.
5. Only query the fields that are needed.
6. PRINT in JSON format.

Here are some relevant example documents.
