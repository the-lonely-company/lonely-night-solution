FIRST_LAYER_PROMPT = '''You are a wine profile suggestion AI. Your task is to design a wine profile that will be used to look for wines in a database. You are composed of 3 steps. Follow the steps below and only output under the fields.

First step is to break down the user query into following fields. Follow these fields.
1. Condition: analyze the conditions in the user's query.
2. Requirements: user's specific requirement on wines.

Second step is a thinking process to give a solution to the first step's findings. Be more specific on the description of wines in this step. Follow these fields.
1. Analysis: analyze the findings from step one. 
2. Proposal: propose the wine suggestion profile as a solution to the user's query based on analysis.

Third step is to extract the profile features in the second step. This step's result will be used as a reference to look for wines in the database. Follow these fields.
1. Detail: state the detail of wines.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"$defs": {"Detail": {"properties": {"types": {"anyOf": [{"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/WineType"}, "type": "array"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Types of wines: Red, Ros\u00e9, White, Sparkling, Dessert, or Fortified. Null if not specified.", "title": "Types"}, "grapes": {"anyOf": [{"items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Grapes, null if not specified.", "title": "Grapes"}, "alcohol": {"anyOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/QuantitativeRange"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Alcohol content, null if user did not specify."}, "vintages": {"anyOf": [{"items": {"type": "integer"}, "type": "array"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Vintages, null if user did not specify.", "title": "Vintages"}, "price": {"anyOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/QuantitativeRange"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Price in HKD currency, null if user did not specify in the query."}, "regions": {"anyOf": [{"items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Regions, null if not specified.", "title": "Regions"}, "wineries": {"anyOf": [{"items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Wineries, null if not specified.", "title": "Wineries"}, "quantity": {"anyOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/QuantitativeRange"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Quantity, null if user did not specify."}, "description": {"anyOf": [{"type": "string"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Characteristics of the suggested wines, sweetness, acidity, tannin, alcohol and body.", "title": "Description"}}, "title": "Detail", "type": "object"}, "QuantitativeRange": {"properties": {"minimum": {"anyOf": [{"type": "number"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Minimum of the item, null if not specified.", "title": "Minimum"}, "around": {"anyOf": [{"type": "number"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Around the item range, null if not specified.", "title": "Around"}, "maximum": {"anyOf": [{"type": "number"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "Maximum of the item, null if not specified.", "title": "Maximum"}}, "title": "QuantitativeRange", "type": "object"}, "WineType": {"enum": ["Red wine", "Ros\u00e9 wine", "White wine", "Sparkling wine", "Dessert wine", "Fortified wine"], "title": "WineType", "type": "string"}}, "properties": {"condition": {"description": "Conditions that the wine suggestion profile is under.", "title": "Condition", "type": "string"}, "requirements": {"description": "User's specific requirements on wines", "title": "Requirements", "type": "string"}, "analysis": {"description": "Analyze the findings from condition and requirements.", "title": "Analysis", "type": "string"}, "proposal": {"description": "Propose a suggestion as a solution to conditions and requirements.", "title": "Proposal", "type": "string"}, "detail": {"allOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/Detail"}], "description": "Details of the suggested wines."}}, "required": ["condition", "requirements", "analysis", "proposal", "detail"]}

SECOND_LAYER_PROMPT = '''Given this template below

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['database']
collection = db['collection ']

query = {''field_1": "field_1_value'', ''field_2": "field_2_value''}
result = collection.find(query)

Give an input question, create a syntactically correct query.

1. Convert the input question to a python dictionary to pass in the collection.find method.
2. The final line of code should be a Python dictionary.
3. The dictionary should represent a solution to the input question.
4. PRINT ONLY THE EXPRESSION.
5. Only query the fields that are needed.
6. PRINT in JSON format.

Here are some relevant example documents.
